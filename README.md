# Godot-Mancala

Mancala can be played with 2 people or it can be played solo against an AI.

This is now my fourth project using Godot. I have really enjoyed making Mancala, definitely my favourite project so far. The rules of mancala are simple yet provided a small challenge when trying to translate to code. I went through multiple iterations of how I wanted to implement how mancala is played; even fully developing three different versions of the game before finally deciding on the one I liked the most. This is also my first Godot project that includes any form of AI. This is a very simple implementation that prioritises certain plays over others and does not perform any predictions.
